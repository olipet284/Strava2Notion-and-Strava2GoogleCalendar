# Strava2Notion and Strava2GoogleCalendar

Uploads old Strava activities to a Notion database, and also inserts them into Google Calendar.

New activities can automatically be uploaded using Pipedream. You can use the following template: <https://pipedream.com/new?h=tch_p7f6W2>.

This also works great for when you use Hevy to log workouts and import them using <https://github.com/olipet284/Hevy2Strava> for old workouts and the built in integration with Strava.
